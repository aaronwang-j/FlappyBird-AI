# FlappyBird-AI

An AI that plays Flappy Bird. The AI is powered by artificial neural networks created using an evolutionary algorithm, NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies). In collaboration with Tim Ruscica.

## NEAT
In short, the algorithm mimics Darwin's natural selection by assigning fitness scores to each bird; these scores are incremented based on how long each bird lives, and those with the highest fitness scores play in the next generation with a set mutation rate. As generations progress, the best artificial neural network architecture and weights that lead to the highest fitness score will be found and utilized.

## Results
The AI will find an optimal neural network within five generations, but will often find it within the first three.

## Instructions
Download the files, run flappybird.py, and watch the AI train itself to conquer Flappy Bird. Enjoy!
